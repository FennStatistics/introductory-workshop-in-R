## Definition: What is statistics?

- Statistics is the science of responsible data analysis.
- Statistics is a cross-sectional discipline that is characterized by a combination of knowledge in
  - Mathematics (abstraction, modeling, stochastics, numerics),
  - Computer science (programming, scientific computing),
  - Fields of application (life, natural or economic sciences, etc.).
- Statistical modeling allows the description of stochastic phenomena and thus supports the finding of rational decisions under uncertainty.


<br>

Encyclopedia Britannica: Statistics is the art and science of gathering, analyzing and making inferences from data. Originally associated with numbers gathered for governments, the subject now includes large bodies of method and theory.

## The theoretical master-mind: The Statistician

**Statisticians:** theoretical driven, discussing terms like point estimates, margins of error, confidence intervals and are separated between  “Frequentists” and “Bayesians”
  - The Frequentist approach to statistics (and testing) is a method which makes predictions on the underlying truths of the experiment, using only data from the current experiment.
  - The Bayesian approach to statistics is a method that encodes past knowledge of similar experiments into a statistical device, known as prior. This prior is combined with current experiment data to make a conclusion on the test (knowledge accumulation).

## Getting Things Done - projects

**projects:**
*a project is anything we want to do that requires more than one action step. It’s therefore a mechanism to remember that, when we finish that first action step, there will still be something more to do*


1. Set up a project list, which is an index, in no particular order, of all your open loops (to dos).

2. For every project define at least the first next action step (OR waiting for, or calendar action).

3. The Projects list and project plans are typically reviewed in your GTD Weekly Review, ensuring each project has at least one current next action, waiting for, or calendar item.

4. It’s fine to have multiple next actions on any given project, as long as they are parallel and not sequential actions.

5. Projects are listed by the outcome you will achieve when you can mark it as done.
  + Effective project names motivate you toward the outcome you wish to achieve, and give you clear direction about what you are trying to accomplish.
  
<br>
<br>
=> that's how you set up a **learning plan**

## Introduction to R

* R is a programming language and tool for statistical computing and data analysis
* consist of basic functionalities (i.e., objects and functions) as well as packages that allow for robust and efficient coding
* in R are multiple object-oriented programming (OOP) included like S3, R6, S4, ..., enables *polymorphism* (use the same function form for different types of input)


```{r}
summary(c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
```


```{r}
summary(rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 20))
```

Important:
* Everything that exists is an object.
* Everything that happens is a function call.


<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## Side-Note: Polymorphism?

```{r}
methods(generic.function = "summary")[1:20]
```

other important functions are: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
?typeof
?class
?mode
```

<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## set your working directory

* every time when starting R set your working directory (or better create an R Project*)

<br>

<center>
<img src="images/workingdir_pic.png", width="50%">
</center>

*you could also use the R API: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# sets the directory of location of this script as the current directory
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path))
```

<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## your workflow

! **modular programming**

<br>

if using R projects: 
* Create a project folder
* In this folder, organize your file in subfolders (e.g., data)
* All filepaths in your script(s) are specified relative to the folder’s top level
* Thus, your working directory is always this top level


<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## Side-Note: modular programming?

you separate your programs into separate functional units (modules). Each module does a well-defined task and the modules are called by one-another as needed. Typically, the state of each module is encapsulated and only supposed to be altered by the functions from that module.

<center>
<img src="images/modular_programming.jpg", height=350px">
</center>


> Modular programming decomposes a large program into modules!



<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## Side-Note: modular programming - Importance

without following the principle of modular programming (*or sometimes structured programming*) you cannot set up a typical data science project:

see in detail: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html


<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## RStudio Projects

When using a project, RStudio will automatically set your working directory to the location of the project file.

Additionally, RStudio will

* load .RData files
* load .RHistory files
* open source files (scripts)
* restore RStudio settings

This will particularly benefit your workflow when collaborating with others/sharing your script, for example by using

## basic data structures - construction & coercion I


.pull-left[
**Explanation:**

Coercion: When you call a function with an argument of the wrong type, R will try to coerce values to a different type so that the function will work. R will convert from more specific types to more general types.


**R commands:**

you define a vector x as follows
```{r eval=TRUE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
x
typeof(x); class(x)
```
]

.pull-right[
**R commands:**


change the second element of the vector to the word “hat.”
```{r eval=TRUE}
x[2] <- "hat"
x
typeof(x); class(x)
```
]



<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## basic data structures - construction & coercion II


.pull-left[
**Explanation:**

Coercion: 
* coerce to a type xxx by as.xxx()
* check if xxx is a specific type by is.xxx()
* when combining different data types, they will be coerced to the most flexible type
* coercion often happens automatically

]

.pull-right[
**R commands:**

```{r eval=TRUE}
x <- 1
is.numeric(x)
as.logical(x)
x <- c(FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
as.numeric(x)
```
]



<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## basic data structures - represent nothing


.pull-left[
**Explanation:**

In R, there are three ways to represent 'nothing', but the reason for the missingness of the information can be distinguished:
* NA: missing sample values, impossible coercion, . . .
* NaN: undefined results in mathematical operation (e.g. log(-1), 1/0)
* NULL: null pointer, i.e. pointer in empty/undefined memory
]

.pull-right[
**R commands:**

```{r eval=TRUE}
c(3, NA)
c(3, 0/0)
c(3, NULL)
max(3, NA)
```
]


<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## basic data structures - Infinity


.pull-left[
**Explanation:**

Some mathematical operations can be performed with Inf and -Inf:
]

.pull-right[
**R commands:**

```{r eval=TRUE}
max(3, Inf)
min(3, Inf)
c(Inf + Inf, (-Inf) * Inf, Inf - Inf)

## complex data types


complex data structures in R can be organized by their dimensionality and if all their contents are of the same type (homogeneous), or not (heterogeneous)

.pull-left[
**homogeneous:**

* 1d atomic vector
```{r eval=FALSE}
1:10; c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
```

* 2d matrix
```{r eval=FALSE}
matrix(data = NA, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
```

* nd array
```{r eval=FALSE}
array(1:60, dim=c(3,4,5))
```
]

.pull-right[
**heterogeneous:**

* 1d list
```{r eval=FALSE}
list(1:10, letters)
```

* 2d matrix data frame
```{r eval=FALSE}
data.frame(id = 1:26, 
           letters = letters, 
           constant = "Hello World")
```
]

## complex data types - very rare in psychology (social science)

often we have simple relational databases, which are made of
* **column**, which represents a variable (like ID)
* **rows**, which represents an instance of data in the data set (like a participant)


```{r}
DT::datatable(dat_twins, options = list(pageLength = 5))
```



<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## every data set should be accompanied by a codebook

Sample size N = 20
Variables (columns):
* ID: Identifier of the individual person
* IDZP: Identifier of the twin pair
* GR: Birth order
* GES: Sex (1 = male, 2 = female)
* OG: Surface area of the cerebral cortex in cm2
* VG: Volume of the forebrain in cm3
* CC: Area of the corpus callosum in cm2
* KU: Circumference of head in cm
* IQ: Intelligence quotient
* KG: Body weight in kg
* additionally IQ.cat: grouped intelligence quotient in 3 groups


Study: https://n.neurology.org/content/50/5/1246


<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## Side-Note: the most scientific study ever


Hypothesis: the size and shape of the human forebrain predict intelligence!

## complex data types - the SQL side of the story


for huge data sets you could use, for example SQL (Structured Query Language), which is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system; check out: https://www.dbis.informatik.uni-goettingen.de/Mondial/  

> multiple relational databases are matched by a primary key / multiple primary keys

and complex data bases can be depicted for example as entity relationship models:

<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## complex data types - add attributes


All objects can have arbitrary additional attributes, used to store metadata about the object

* can be thought of as a named list (with unique names); other frequently encountered attributes: "dimnames", "names", "class"(!)
* can be accessed individually with attr() or all at once (as a list) with attributes()
* arrays are simply vectors with a "dim"-attribute.
* factor is a vector with attribute levels





.pull-left[

```{r eval=TRUE}
dat <- data.frame(id = 1:26, 
           letters = letters, 
           constant = "Hello World")
head(dat)
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r eval=TRUE}
attr(x = dat, which = "names")
attributes(x = dat)
```

]



<!-- *********** NEW SLIDE ************** -->
---
## hands-on: try out the different data structures

Hint: we have the following data structures: 

.pull-left[
**homogeneous:**

* 1d atomic vector
```{r eval=FALSE}
1:10; c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
```
* 2d matrix
```{r eval=FALSE}
matrix(data = NA, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
```
* nd array
```{r eval=FALSE}
array(1:60, dim=c(3,4,5))
```
]

.pull-right[
**heterogeneous:**

* 1d list
```{r eval=FALSE}
list(1:10, letters)
```

* 2d matrix data frame
```{r eval=FALSE}
data.frame(id = 1:26, 
           letters = letters, 
           constant = "Hello World")
```
]

If you want to save your data structures to an R object e.g. write: 
```{r eval=FALSE}
myFirstVector <- 1:10
```
