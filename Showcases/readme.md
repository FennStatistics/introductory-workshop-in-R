# Showcases

These showcases demonstrate what is possible with R. The first example (`getMeARoom.R`) presents an end-to-end data scraping and simple regression analysis, while the second (`ESS`) revisits an older analysis in RMarkdown (better use the [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) framework).

## Examples

### 1. getMeARoom.R

This script scrapes rental listings from a shared flat website, cleans and prepares the data, and applies a **hedonic price model** to explore how features like size and number of flatmates influence rent prices. It includes data visualization, regression analysis, and interactive exploration of outliers.

### 2. ESS (European Social Survey)

This RMarkdown document conducts an **exploratory and logistic-regression-based analysis** of public concern about rising energy prices using ESS data. It includes:
- Descriptive stats
- Visual comparisons across countries
- Logistic and ordinal logistic regression (focused on Switzerland)
- Interpretation of social and political trust variables

> Note: This second example uses legacy RMarkdown syntax, though [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is recommended for new projects.
