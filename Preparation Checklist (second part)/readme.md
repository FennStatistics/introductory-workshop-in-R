# 🧠 R Workshop Preparation Checklist

To get the most out of the second part of our R workshop, please complete the following preparation steps.

## 📘 Why Learn Dynamic Documents?

If you're still unsure about the value of dynamic documents, read the introductory sections of [*Dynamic Documents with R and knitr*](https://duhi23.github.io/Analisis-de-datos/Yihue.pdf):

> Dynamic documents combine code and text in a single source file to produce reports with embedded results. This improves reproducibility and efficiency—any change in code or data is reflected in the final output automatically.

## 🛠️ Tools We’ll Use

This workshop will use the [**Quarto**](https://quarto.org/) framework, built on top of [R Markdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/).

### Optional but Recommended Resources

- [DataCamp: Reporting with R Markdown](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/reporting-with-rmarkdown)  
  💡 *Free with [GitHub Student Pack](https://education.github.com/pack)*
- [Quarto User Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)
- [APA 7 Style Quarto Extension](https://github.com/wjschne/apaquarto)

## 🧪 Statistical Procedures – Workshop Overview

This section outlines the statistical procedures we will cover, based on student requests and aligned with the **Data Analysis Pipeline**:

📘 I highly recommend to immerse yourself into the statistical procedures you need, for possible ressources check out the recommended [learning materials (online document)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z40Rkux_Ysq15VziCJJH21ca07ipwN52dA_LFYIsZ2g/edit?usp=sharing) of mine

### 1. **Data Import & Preparation**
- Importing SPSS and CSV data  
- Merging participant data into wide format  
- Data cleaning (e.g., applying exclusion criteria)  
- Creating composite scores, reversing items, calculating percentages  

### 2. **Hypothesis Test**
- Summary statistics  
- Assumption checks (e.g., Shapiro test, homoscedasticity, independence)  
- *t*-test
- One-way and factorial ANOVA  
- Mixed-design ANOVA (within- and between-subjects)  

> including reaction time analysis

### 3. **Regression & Mediation Analysis**
- Linear and multiple regression  
- Logistic regression with interactions  
- Poisson regression  
- Moderation and mediation in R  

### 4. **Multilevel & Mixed Models, GLMMs**
- Linear mixed-effects models (LMMs, GLMMs - mixed logistic model)  
- Hierarchical linear models (multilevel analysis)  

> including reaction time and error analysis

### 5. **Psychometrics & Questionnaire Data**
- Cronbach’s alpha  
- Factor analysis  
- Validating 7-point Likert scales  

### 6. **Reporting & Visualization**
- Creating and customizing plots  
- APA-style figures and tables (APA 7th edition)  



### Only explaining: **Automation & Workflow**
- Automating analysis pipelines  
- Tidyverse workflow integration  
- Writing reusable scripts and functions (e.g., ExParA, JASP workflows)
