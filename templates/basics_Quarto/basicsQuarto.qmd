# 🛠️ RStudio Toolbar: Key Buttons for Quarto Documents

When working with Quarto documents (`.qmd`) in RStudio, several toolbar buttons facilitate efficient editing, rendering, and publishing. Understanding these buttons will streamline your workflow.

## 🔄 Render

* **Function**: Executes the code in your Quarto document and generates the output in the specified format (e.g., HTML, PDF).
* **Location**: Found in the toolbar above the editor pane.
* **Usage**: Click to render the document. If multiple formats are specified in the YAML front matter, it renders the first listed format by default.

## 💾 Render on Save

* **Function**: Automatically renders the document each time you save it.
* **Location**: Checkbox next to the Render button in the toolbar.
* **Usage**: Enable this option to keep your output up-to-date with every save, facilitating real-time previews.

## 👁️ Preview Options

* **Function**: Controls where and how the rendered output is displayed.
* **Location**: Accessible via the gear icon next to the Render button.
* **Options**:

  * **Preview in Viewer Pane**: Displays the output within RStudio's Viewer pane.
  * **Preview in Window**: Opens the output in a separate window or browser tab.
  * **No Preview**: Suppresses automatic preview display after rendering.

## 📤 Publish

* **Function**: Deploys your rendered Quarto document to external platforms such as Quarto Pub, GitHub Pages, or Posit Connect.
* **Location**: Located in the toolbar, typically represented by an upward arrow icon.
* **Usage**: Click to initiate the publishing process. You'll be prompted to select a destination and configure settings accordingly.

## 📝 Visual Editor Toggle

* **Function**: Switches between the source code editor and a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) visual editor.
* **Location**: Buttons labeled "Source" and "Visual" at the top-right corner of the editor pane.
* **Usage**: Toggle to the Visual Editor for a more intuitive editing experience, especially useful for formatting text, inserting images, and managing citations.

## ▶️ Run

* **Function**: Executes code within your document without rendering the entire file.
* **Location**: Located in the toolbar above the editor pane.
* **Usage**:

  * **Run Selected Line(s)**: Select code and click Run or press `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Enter` (macOS) to execute.
  * **Run Current Chunk**: Place the cursor within a code chunk and click Run to execute the entire chunk.
  * **Run All**: Use the dropdown next to the Run button to execute all code chunks in the document.

# 📄 Introduction to Quarto Markdown

Quarto enables you to create dynamic documents by combining plain text with executable code. Understanding Markdown syntax is essential for formatting your documents effectively. Below are the fundamental elements:

## 1. **Headings**

Use the `#` symbol to create headings. The number of `#` symbols indicates the heading level:

```markdown
# Heading Level 1
## Heading Level 2
### Heading Level 3
```


## 2. **Emphasis**

* *Italic*: Wrap text with one asterisk or underscore: `*italic*` or `_italic_`
* **Bold**: Wrap text with two asterisks or underscores: `**bold**` or `__bold__`
* ***Bold and Italic***: Combine both: `***bold and italic***`

## 3. **Lists**

* **Unordered Lists**: Use `-`, `*`, or `+` followed by a space:

  ```markdown
  - Item 1
  - Item 2
  ```

* **Ordered Lists**: Use numbers followed by a period:

  ```markdown
  1. First item
  2. Second item
  ```

## 4. **Links and Images**

* **Hyperlinks**: `[Link Text](URL)`

  Example:

  ```markdown
  [Quarto Documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/)
  ```

* **Images**: `![Alt Text](Image URL)`

  Example:

  ```markdown
  ![R is so cool](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64165327/95934136-26177f00-0d9e-11eb-8bdc-748ee65ad17a.png)
  ```
  
## 5. **Blockquotes**

Use `>` to create blockquotes:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
```

## 6. **Code**

* **Inline Code**: Use backticks `` ` `` to enclose code within a line:

  ```markdown
  I can now compute the mean from 1 to 5 within my document: `r mean(c(1:5))`
  ```

* **Code Blocks**: Use triple backticks to create code blocks. It is possible to apply different programming languages:

like R:

```{r eval=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```


or Python:  

```{python eval=FALSE}
1 + 1
```


## 7. **Tables**

Create tables using pipes `|` and hyphens `-`:

```markdown
| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Data 1   | Data 2   |
```

## 8. **Mathematical Notation**

Quarto supports LaTeX-style math expressions:

* **Inline Math**: Use single dollar signs: `$...$`

  Example:

  ```markdown
  The equation of a line is $y = mx + b$.
  ```

* **Display Math**: Use double dollar signs:

  ```markdown
  $$
  E = mc^2
  $$
  ```

## 9. **Callout Blocks**

Highlight important information using callout blocks:

```markdown
::: note
This is a note.
:::

::: warning
This is a warning.
:::
```


## 10. **YAML Front Matter**

At the beginning of your `.qmd` file, include metadata enclosed by `---`:

```yaml
---
title: "The tiny Quarto guide"
author: "Julius Fenn"
date: today
format:
  html:
    toc: true
    toc-depth: 3
    html-math-method: katex
bibliography: Library_subset.bib
biblio-style: apalike
link-citations: true
---
```

Ensure proper indentation and spacing in the YAML section to avoid errors.



# Real Application Case

Please read [Quarto Using R](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/r.html) and play around with the following code:

---


Let’s demonstrate a real-world example using the built-in `iris` dataset, which contains measurements of different iris flower species.

We begin by displaying the first few rows of the dataset. We’ll use a code chunk with `echo = TRUE` to display both the code and its output:

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Show the first six rows of the iris dataset
head(iris)
```

If you want to **show only the output and not the code**, use the chunk option `echo = FALSE`:

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(iris)
dim(iris)
```

> ✅ `echo = FALSE` is useful in final reports where you want to focus on the results without showing the underlying R code.

You can also **suppress the output** using `eval = FALSE`, which means the code won't be run:

```{r eval=TRUE}
# This code won't be executed
plot(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width)
cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width) # default is Pearson
```

```{r}
cor(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, method = "spearman")
```



Now, let’s perform a simple data analysis:

## Mean Sepal Length by Species

We can compute the average sepal length for each species using the `aggregate()` function. Here, we use `message = FALSE` and `warning = FALSE` to suppress potential messages or warnings.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
agg_means <- aggregate(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris, mean)
agg_means
```

> 💡 `message = FALSE` and `warning = FALSE` are useful for cleaner outputs, especially when functions produce startup messages or minor warnings.

## Plotting

We now generate a boxplot of Sepal Length by Species and interpret the result.

```{r fig.cap="Boxplot of Sepal Length by Species", fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
boxplot(Sepal.Length ~ Species, data = iris,
        main = "Sepal Length by Species",
        xlab = "Species", ylab = "Sepal Length (cm)",
        col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen", "lightpink"))
```




The highest average sepal length is `r max(agg_means$Sepal.Length)`


> 🧠 **Inline code** lets us reference live results directly in text. This ensures your interpretations remain in sync with your data.



# Global Chunk Options

To avoid repeating the same chunk options (like `echo = FALSE`, `message = FALSE`, etc.) in every code block, you can set them **globally** at the beginning of your document using the `knitr::opts_chunk$set()` function.

This is done in a setup chunk, which is typically not shown in the output.

```{r setup, include=TRUE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  include = FALSE,
  message = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  fig.align = "center"
)
```

Code is evaluated, but not shown or included:

```{r}
randomNumbers <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 0, sd = 1) 
plot(randomNumbers)
```
